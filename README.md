Hello, my name is Alexander Zeitlhofer. I am a motivated software developer and currently a student at IT-HTL Ybbs, where I apply and deepen my knowledge in practice.

During my education, I have acquired solid expertise in Java, C, and C# and have successfully applied these skills in various projects.

One of the highlights of my journey so far is my diploma project, which I am currently working on: the development of an indie game using Unreal Engine. This project allows me to fully embrace my passion for game development.

Additionally, I have advanced skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as experience with frameworks like React, enabling me to create innovative web applications.

You can reach me at `alex.zeitlhofer@outlook.at`.
